1. I coded a platform to be able to post, edit, update, and delete recipes. You can add the name and the steps to complete the recipe, as well as add a picture of the dish and a tag to describe that dish.
2. I was trying to use Material UI to style my website, but I couldn't get it to work for one of my components, so I decided to use React-bootstrap instead. Another thing that didn't work was image re-sizing.
3. EC: I handled axios errors by displaying to the user that the website is experiencing technical difficulties and that they should come back and check again in a few minutes. I tested my error handling by changing the root URL to something other than the correct URL.
